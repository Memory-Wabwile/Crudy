  <h1>Access control</h1>
  <p>
    Access control is a critical aspect of web applications, as it ensures that
    users can only access the resources and features for which they have
    permission. In this section, we'll explore how to manage user permissions
    and roles in your Laravel application.
  </p>
  <p>
    User permissions and roles are a critical aspect of web applications, as
    they ensure that users can only access the resources and features for which
    they have permission. Laravel provides a number of features for managing
    user permissions and roles, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Permissions: Permissions are individual actions that a user can perform,
      such as create posts or edit users.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roles: Roles are groups of permissions that can be assigned to users. For
      example, an administrator role might have the create posts, edit posts,
      and delete posts permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gateways: Gateways are used to check if a user has permission to perform a
      certain action. For example, you could use a gateway to check if a user
      has permission to create a new post before allowing them to access the
      post creation form.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let us discuss how to implement access control in Laravel.</p>
  <p>
    Laravel provides a powerful package called Laravel Breeze, which is a
    minimal and elegant implementation of authentication and access control. To
    implement access control in your Laravel application:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install Laravel Breeze:</li>
    <p>Start by installing Laravel Breeze using Composer:</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            composer require laravel/breeze --dev
         </code></pre>
    </div>

    <li>Generate Authentication Scaffolding:</li>
    <p>Use the Artisan command to generate authentication scaffolding:</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            php artisan breeze:install
           </code></pre>
    </div>
    <li>Configure Roles and Permissions:</li>
    <p>
      You can use a package like Spatie Laravel Permissions to manage roles and
      permissions. Install it via Composer:
    </p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            composer require spatie/laravel-permission
             </code></pre>
    </div>
  </ol>
  <br />

  <p>
    To manage user permissions and roles in your Laravel application, you will
    need to:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a permissions table in your database.</li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
        class Permission extends Model
        {
            public $table = 'permissions';            
        
            protected $fillable = [
                'name',
                'guard_name',
            ];
        }       
               </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The permissions table will store the names of all of the permissions in
      your application. The table should have the following columns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>id: The primary key of the table.</li>
      <li>name: The name of the permission.</li>
      <li>guard_name: The name of the guard that the permission belongs to</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Create a roles table in your database.</li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
        class Role extends Model
        {
            public $table = 'roles';            
        
            protected $fillable = [
                'name',
                'guard_name',
            ];            
        
            public function permissions()
            {
                return $this->belongsToMany(Permission::class);
            }
        }
                 </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The roles table will store the names of all of the roles in your
      application. The table should have the following columns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>id: The primary key of the table.</li>
      <li>name: The name of the role.</li>
      <li>guard_name: The name of the guard that the role belongs to.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Create a permission pivot table to link permissions and roles.</li>
    <p>Create a migration file for you to edit.</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            php artisan make:migration create_permission_role_pivot_table
                   </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The permission pivot table will link permissions and roles together. The
      table should have the following columns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>permission_id: The ID of the permission.</li>
      <li>role_id: The ID of the role.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Create a permissions model and a rolesâ€™ model.</li>
    <p>
      Create two new PHP files, Permission.php and Role.php, and add the
      following code to each file, respectively:
    </p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>

                    return $this->belongsToMany(Permission::class);
                }
            }            
                     </code></pre>

                    'name' => 'create posts',
                    'guard_name' => 'web',
                ]);            
            
                Permission::create([

                       </code></pre>
    </div>
    <li>
      Run the permissions migration and the roles migration to create the tables
      in your database.

    </div>

    <li>
      Seed the permissions and roles tables with your desired permissions and
      roles. You can use the Laravel seeder to seed the permissions and roles
      tables. For example, the following seeder will seed the permissions table
      with three permissions and the roles table with two roles:
    </li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            // database/seeds/PermissionsAndRolesSeeder.php

            namespace Database\Seeders;            
            
            use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;            
            
            class PermissionsAndRolesSeeder extends Seeder
            {
                public function run()
                {
                    // Seed the permissions table.
                    $permissions = [
                        [
                            'name' => 'create posts',
                            'guard_name' => 'web',
                        ],
                        [
                            'name' => 'edit posts',
                            'guard_name' => 'web',
                        ],
                        [
                            'name' => 'delete posts',
                            'guard_name' => 'web',
                        ],
                 //...........

            }         
    </code></pre>
    </div>

    <li>Assign permissions to roles.</li>
    <p>This is how you assign permission to roles:</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            $role = Role::find(1);
            $role->givePermissionTo('create posts');
                     </code></pre>
    </div>

    <li>Assign roles to users.</li>
    <p>The following code is used to assign role to users:</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            $user = User::find(1);
            $user->assignRole('administrator');
                     </code></pre>
    </div>
    <li>Check user permissions using gateways.</li>
    <p>This is how we shall be checking permissions:</p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            Gate::authorize('create posts');
                     </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      If the user has permission to create posts, the
      <strong>Gate::authorize()</strong> method will return true. Otherwise, the
      <strong>Gate::authorize()</strong> method will return false.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also use the <strong>can()</strong> method on the User model to
      check user permissions. The following code would check if the user has
      permission to create a new post:
    </p>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            $user = User::find(1);

            if ($user->can('create posts')) {
                // Allow the user to create a new post.
            } else {
                // Deny the user permission to create a new post.
            }
            
                       </code></pre>
    </div>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To recap, access control is essential for managing user permissions and
    ensuring the security and integrity of your Laravel application. With
    Laravel Breeze and packages like Spatie Laravel Permissions, you can easily
    implement role-based access control and protect your application's
    resources.

  <h1>File uploading and finishing up</h1>
  <p>
    File uploading is a common requirement for web applications, and Laravel
    provides built-in features to handle file uploads seamlessly. In this
    section, we'll explore how to allow users to upload files and images in your
    Laravel application.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Uploading Files with Laravel</p>
  <p>
    Laravel makes it easy to handle file uploads with the help of the
    <strong>Illuminate\Http\Request</strong> object and the
    <strong>file()</strong> method. Here's how you can set up file uploads in
    your Laravel application:
  </p>
  <p>To set up file uploads in your Laravel application, you will need to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a route to handle the file upload request.</li>
    <li>Create a controller to handle the file upload request.</li>
    <li>Validate the file upload request.</li>
    <li>Save the uploaded file to storage.</li>
    <li>Return a success response to the user.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Step 1: Create a route to handle the file upload request<br />
    The following route will handle file upload requests:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
            // routes/web.php

            Route::post('/upload-file', [FileUploadController::class, 'store']);
              
                         </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    Step 2: Create a controller to handle the file upload request <br />The
    following controller will handle the file upload request:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        // app/Http/Controllers/FileUploadController.php

        namespace App\Http\Controllers;        
        
        use Illuminate\Http\Request;
        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;        
        
        class FileUploadController extends Controller
        {
            public function store(Request $request)
            {
                // Get the uploaded file.
                $file = $request->file('file');        
        
                // Validate the uploaded file.
                $file->validate([
                    'required',
                    'file',
                    'max:2048', // 2MB maximum file size
                ]);        
        
                // Save the uploaded file to storage.
                $filename = Storage::disk('public')->putFile('uploads', $file);        
        
                // Return a success response to the user.
                return response()->json([
                    'message' => 'File uploaded successfully.',
                    'filename' => $filename,
                ]);
            }
        }
        
              
                         </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The <strong>$request->file('file')</strong> method returns the uploaded
    file. The $file->validate() method validates the uploaded file. The
    <strong>Storage::disk('public')->putFile()</strong> method saves the
    uploaded file to the uploads directory on the public disk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 3: Validate the file upload request <br />The following code validates
    the file upload request:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
    $file->validate([
        'required',
        'file',
        'max:2048', // 2GB maximum file size
    ]);
    
                         </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    Step 4: Save the uploaded file to storage<br />

    The following code saves the uploaded file to storage:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        $filename = Storage::disk('public')->putFile('uploads', $file);
                         </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This code will save the uploaded file to the uploads directory on the public
    disk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 5: Return a success response to the user<br />

    The following code returns a success response to the user:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'File uploaded successfully.',
        'filename' => $filename,
    ]);    
                         </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This code will return a JSON response to the user with a message indicating
    that the file was uploaded successfully and the filename of the uploaded
    file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Example<br />
    The following example shows how to upload a file using a simple HTML form:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        &lt;form action="/upload-file" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            &lt;input type="file" name="file">
            &lt;button type="submit">Upload File&lt;/button>
        &lt;/form>   
                         </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    When the user submits the form, the file will be uploaded to the server and
    saved to storage. You can then access the uploaded file in the following
    format URL:
    <strong><em>http://domain.com/storage/uploads/filename</em></strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    When handling file uploads, it is essential to include validation and
    security measures to protect your application from malicious attacks.
    Laravel provides a number of built-in validation rules and methods to help
    you validate and secure uploaded files.

    <li>Validation</li>
    <p>
      Laravel provides a number of built-in validation rules for uploaded files,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>required:</strong> The file is required.</li>
      <li><strong>file:</strong> The file is a valid file.</li>
      <li><strong>mimes:</strong> The file is of a specific MIME type.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>max:</strong> The file size is less than or equal to a specified
        maximum size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>min:</strong> The file size is greater than or equal to a
        specified minimum size.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can use these validation rules in your Laravel controllers to validate
      uploaded files before saving them to storage.
    </p>

    <li>Security</li>
    <p>
      Laravel provides a number of built-in security measures for uploaded
      files, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        File scanning: Laravel can scan uploaded files for viruses and malware
        using the ClamAV antivirus scanner.
      </li>
      <li>
        File hashing: Laravel can generate a hash for each uploaded file and
        store it in the database. This can be used to verify the integrity of
        uploaded files and detect any changes that may have been made to them
        after they were uploaded.
      </li>
      <li>
        File storage: Laravel can store uploaded files in a variety of
        locations, including on the local filesystem, in the cloud, or on a
        remote server. This helps to protect uploaded files from unauthorized
        access.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following example shows how to validate and secure an uploaded file
      using Laravel:
    </p>
  </ol>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        // app/Http/Controllers/FileUploadController.php

        namespace App\Http\Controllers;        
        
        use Illuminate\Http\Request;
        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;        
        
        class FileUploadController extends Controller
        {
            public function store(Request $request)
            {
                // Validate the uploaded file.
                $request->validate([
                    'file' => 'required|file|mimes:pdf,docx|max:1024',
                ]);
        
        
                // Scan the uploaded file for viruses and malware.
                if (!ClamAV::scan($request->file('file'))) {
                    // The file is infected with a virus or malware.
                }
        
        
                // Generate a hash for the uploaded file.
                $hash = Hash::make($request->file('file'));        
        
                // Save the uploaded file to storage.
                $filename = Storage::disk('public')->putFile('uploads', $request->file('file'));        
        
                // Store the file hash in the database.
                $file = new File([
                    'name' => $filename,
                    'hash' => $hash,
                ]);
                $file->save();        
        
                // Return a success response to the user.
                return response()->json([
                    'message' => 'File uploaded successfully.',
                    'filename' => $filename,
                ]);
            }
        }
          
                         </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This code validates that the uploaded file is required, is a valid file, is
    a PDF or DOCX file, and is no larger than 1MB. It also scans the uploaded
    file for viruses and malware, generates a hash for the uploaded file, and
    stores the uploaded file to storage and the file hash in the database.
  </p>

  <p>
    To recap, Laravel simplifies the process of handling file uploads in your
    web application. By creating a file upload form, processing the uploaded
    file in your controller, and implementing validation and security measures,
    you can allow users to upload files and images securely.
