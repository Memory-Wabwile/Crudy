  <h1>User authentication</h1>
  <p>
    User authentication is a fundamental aspect of web applications that ensures
    user data security and controls access to various parts of your application.
    In this section of the tutorial, we will explore how to implement user
    authentication in your Laravel application. User authentication in Laravel
    is implemented using the Laravel Auth package. The Auth package provides a
    number of features for authenticating users, including:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Session-based authentication: This is the default authentication method in
      Laravel. Users are authenticated by storing a session ID in their browser
      cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Token-based authentication: This authentication method uses JSON Web
      Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate users. JWTs are self-contained tokens that
      contain all of the information necessary to authenticate a user.
    </li>
    <li>
      API authentication: The Auth package also provides support for API
      authentication. This allows you to authenticate users without having to
      redirect them to a login page.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>
    Laravel comes with a robust built-in authentication system that makes it
    easy to implement user registration, login, and password reset features.
    This system includes various authentication controllers and views, as well
    as the necessary routes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>User Registration</li>
    <p>
      To enable user registration in your application, you can use the
      RegisterController provided by Laravel. This controller manages the
      registration process and stores user data in your database. The
      registration view is also included.
    </p>

    <li>User Login</li>
    <p>
      Laravel's LoginController manages the user login process. Users can log in
      using their email and password. The login view is provided by default as
      well.
    </p>
    <li>Password Reset</li>
    <p>
      Laravel's authentication system includes the ability to reset user
      passwords. Users can request a password reset by providing their email
      address. A password reset email is sent to the user, allowing them to set
      a new password.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Now let us see how to implement these features discussed above:</p>
  <p>
    To implement user authentication in your Laravel application, follow these
    steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install the Laravel Auth package:</li>

    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
        $ composer require laravel/ui
     </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      This command will install the Laravel Auth package, as well as the Laravel
      UI package. Laravel UI is a front-end framework that provides a number of
      components for building user interfaces, including login and registration
      forms.
    </p>

    <li>
      Run the Laravel UI Artisan command to install the authentication
      scaffolding:
    </li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
        $ php artisan ui vue --auth
     </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      This command will install the authentication scaffolding for your Laravel
      application. This includes the login and register views, controllers, and
      routes.
    </p>

    <li>
      Configure the Auth package in the
      <strong>config/auth.php</strong> configuration file.
      <br />
      The <strong> config/auth.php</strong> configuration file contains a number
      of settings for the Auth package. You can configure the authentication
      method (session-based, token-based, or API), the login and register
      routes, and the authentication middleware.
    </li>

    <li>
      Create a <strong>LoginController</strong> and
      <strong>RegisterController</strong> to handle user login and registration.
      The <strong>LoginController</strong> and
      <strong>RegisterController</strong> will handle the login and registration
      requests, respectively. You can customize these controllers to meet your
      specific needs.
    </li>

    <li>
      Add routes to your <strong>routes/web.php</strong> file to handle the
      login and registration requests. The <strong>routes/web.php</strong> file
      contains the routes for your web application. You will need to add routes
      to handle the login and registration requests:
    </li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            Route::get('/login', [LoginController::class, 'login']);
            Route::post('/login', [LoginController::class, 'postLogin']);
            Route::get('/register', [RegisterController::class, 'register']);
            Route::post('/register', [RegisterController::class, 'postRegister']);
       </code></pre>
    </div>
    <li>
      Add authentication middleware to the routes that you want to protect.<br />The
      Auth package provides a number of authentication middleware classes. You
      can use these middleware classes to protect your routes. For example, to
      protect the /admin route, you would add the auth middleware to the
      route.<br />
      Here is how we will protect the /admin route using the auth middleware:
    </li>
    <div class="code-wrapper">
      <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
      <pre><code class="language-js">
            Route::get('/admin', function () {
                // ...
            })->middleware('auth');
         </code></pre>
    </div>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This will ensure that only authenticated users can access the /admin route.
  </p>

  <p>Let us see how a <strong>LoginController</strong> handles user login:</p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

        use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
        use Illuminate\Http\Request;        
        
        class LoginController extends Controller
        {
            public function login(Request $request)
            {
                $credentials = $request->validate([
                    'email' => 'required|email',
                    'password' => 'required',
                ]);        
        
                if (!Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
                    return redirect()->back()
                        ->withErrors(['email' => 'Invalid credentials.']);
                }        
        
                return redirect()->intended();
            }
        }        
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The <strong>namespace</strong> line specifies the namespace for the
    controller. The use lines import the Controller class and the Request class.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>class</strong> line defines the
    <strong>LoginController</strong> class. This class extends the
    <strong>Controller</strong> class. The <strong>login()</strong> method
    handles the login request. This method takes a
    <strong>Request</strong> object as input. The
    <strong>validate()</strong> method validates the login form data. The
    validation rules in this case are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The email field is required and must be a valid email address.</li>
    <li>password: The password field is required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the validation is successful, the <strong>validate()</strong> method
    returns an array containing the validated data. Otherwise, the
    <strong>validate()</strong> method throws a ValidationException exception.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>attempt()</strong> method authenticates the user using the given
    credentials. If the authentication is successful, the
    <strong>attempt()</strong> method returns true. Otherwise, the attempt()
    method returns false. If the authentication is unsuccessful, the
    <strong>login()</strong> method redirects the user back to the login page
    with an error message.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the authentication is successful, the <strong>login()</strong> method
    redirects the user to the intended page. The intended page is the page that
    the user was trying to access before they were redirected to the login page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us see how a <strong>RegisterController</strong> handles user login:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

        use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
        use App\Models\User;
        use Illuminate\Http\Request;        
        
        class RegisterController extends Controller
        {
            public function register(Request $request)
            {
                $request->validate([
                    'name' => 'required|string',
                    'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',
                    'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',
                ]);        
        
                $user = User::create([
                    'name' => $request->input('name'),
                    'email' => $request->input('email'),
                    'password' => Hash::make($request->input('password')),
                ]);        
        
                Auth::login($user);        
        
                return redirect()->intended();
            }
        }               
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>The <strong>use</strong> line imports the Request class.</p>
  <p>
    The <strong>register()</strong> method handles the registration request.
    This method takes a Request object as input.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>validate()</strong> method validates the registration form data.
    The validation rules in this case are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>name: The name field is required and must be a string.</li>
    <li>
      email: The email field is required, must be a valid email address, and
      must be unique in the users table.
    </li>
    <li>
      password: The password field is required, must be at least 8 characters
      long, and must match the confirmation password field.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the validation is successful, the <strong>validate()</strong> method
    returns an array containing the validated data. Otherwise, the
    <strong>validate()</strong> method throws a
    <strong>ValidationException</strong> exception.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>create()</strong> method on the User model creates a new user
    record in the database. The create() method takes an array of data as input.
    The data in the array is used to create the new user record.<br />The
    create() method is passed the following data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>name: The user's name.</li>
    <li>email: The user's email address.</li>
    <li>password: The user's password.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <strong>Hash::make()</strong> method hashes the user's password before
    it is saved to the database. This helps to protect the user's password from
    being compromised.
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>login()</strong> method logs in the user.</p>
  <p>
    The <strong>intended()</strong> method redirects the user to the intended
    page. The intended page is the page that the user was trying to access
    before they were redirected to the registration page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you have implemented user authentication in your Laravel application,
    you can start protecting your routes by adding authentication middleware.
    For example, to protect the <strong>/admin</strong> route, you would add the
    following middleware to the route in your
    <strong>routes/web.php</strong> file:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      Route::get('/admin', function () {
        // ...
      })->middleware('auth');             
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This will ensure that only authenticated users can access the /admin route.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can customize the authentication views, controllers, and routes to match
    your application's design and requirements. These are located in the
    <strong>resources/views/auth, app/Http/Controllers/Auth,</strong> and
    <strong>routes/web.php</strong> files, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    To recap, user authentication is a crucial aspect of web applications, and
    Laravel makes it easy to implement. Laravel's built-in authentication system
    provides controllers, views, and routes for user registration, login, and
    password reset. You can further customize and protect routes to ensure
    secure and controlled access to your application's features.

  <h1>Model relationships</h1>
  <p>
    In this part we will dive into model relationships in Laravel. Model
    relationships allow you to define how different database tables are related
    to each other, enabling you to retrieve and manipulate related data with
    ease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Model relationships in Laravel are used to define the associations between
    database tables. There are several types of relationships:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>One-to-One:</strong> In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a
      table is associated with one record in another table.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One-to-Many:</strong> In a one-to-many relationship, one record in
      a table is associated with multiple records in another table.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Many-to-One</strong> (Belongs To): Many records in a table are
      associated with one record in another table.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Many-to-Many:</strong> Many records in one table are associated
      with many records in another table.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Polymorphic:</strong> This relationship allows you to define a
      relationship between two models that may be of different types. For
      example, a post might have many comments, and those comments could be of
      different types, such as TextComment or ImageComment.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To define a model relationship, you can use the
    <strong>belongsTo(), hasMany(), belongsToMany(), hasOneThrough()</strong>,
    and <strong>morphMany()</strong> methods on your Eloquent models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time to move on and define some relationship, the old age question of what
    are we? Think of a blog application with two models: User and Post. A User
    can have many Post records, and a Post belongs to one User.
  </p>
  <br />

  <p><strong>One-to-Many Relationship</strong></p>
  <p>
    In the User model, you can define a one-to-many relationship to represent
    that a user has many posts:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
class User extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}           
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code above defines a one-to-many relationship between the User and Post
    models. This means that a single user can have many posts, but a single post
    can only belong to one user. The <strong>hasMany()</strong> method on the
    User model tells Laravel that a user can have many posts. The
    <strong>Post::class</strong> argument to the
    <strong>hasMany()</strong> method tells Laravel that the relationship is
    with the Post model.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Post model, you can define a many-to-one (belongs to) relationship to
    represent that a post belongs to a user:
  </p>

  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}         
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code above defines a belongs-to relationship between the Post and User
    models. This means that a single post can only belong to one user, but a
    user can have many posts.<br />
    The <strong>belongsTo()</strong> method on the Post model tells Laravel that
    a post belongs to one user. The <strong>User::class</strong> argument to the
    <strong>belongsTo()</strong> method tells Laravel that the relationship is
    with the User model.
  </p>
  <br />

  <p>
    With these relationships defined, you can easily retrieve a user's posts or
    the author of a post. Once you've defined relationships between your models,
    you can retrieve related data using Eloquent. For example, to get all the
    posts of a user:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      $user = User::find(1);
      $posts = $user->posts;      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The code above retrieves all of the posts for a given user using the
    Eloquent model relationships in Laravel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>User::find(1)</strong> code finds the user with the ID of 1. The
    <strong>$posts = $user->posts</strong> code then retrieves all of the posts
    for that user. This is possible because of the one-to-many relationship that
    is defined between the User and Post models. This is possible because of the
    <strong>one-to-many</strong>
    relationship that is defined between the User and Post models. The
    <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship means that a single user can have
    many posts, but a single post can only belong to one user. This code can be
    used in a variety of ways. For example, it could be used to display a list
    of all of the posts that a user has written, or to allow users to edit their
    own posts.
  </p>

  <p>You can also find the author of a post:</p>

  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      $post = Post::find(1);
      $user = $post->user;      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The <strong>Post::find(1)</strong> code finds the post with the ID of 1. The
    <strong>$user = $post->user</strong> code then retrieves the user for that
    post. This is possible because of the belongs-to relationship that is
    defined between the Post and User models.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Post::find() method takes the ID of a post as input and returns the post
    object. In this case, the <strong>find()</strong> method is used to find the
    post with the ID of 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>$post->user</strong> code retrieves the user for the post. This
    is possible because of the belongs-to relationship that is defined between
    the Post and User models. The belongs-to relationship means that a single
    post can only belong to one user, but a user can have many posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    This code can be used in a variety of ways. For example, it could be used to
    display the author of a post, or to allow users to vote on posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    To recap, model relationships in Laravel allow you to define and work with
    the associations between database tables. This makes it easier to retrieve
    and manipulate related data, creating more organized and efficient
    applications.
