  <h2>Middleware</h2>
  <p>
    We have explored and seen this term before in the tutorial, however, in this
    part, we will delve deeper into Express.js middleware. Middleware is a
    powerful feature that allows you to perform various tasks during the
    request/response cycle. We will create more advanced middleware functions
    and explore their roles in building web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will create advanced middleware functions to demonstrate their
    capabilities.
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        // Middleware for logging requests
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
        next(); // Continue to the next middleware or route handler
        });        
        
        // Custom middleware to check for user authentication
        const checkAuth = (req, res, next) => {
        if (req.query.auth === 'true') {
        next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
        } else {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized'); // Respond with a 401 status for unauthenticated requests
        }
        };
        // Apply the 'checkAuth' middleware to specific routes
        app.get('/secured', checkAuth, (req, res) => {
        res.send('This is a secured route.');
        });
        
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. This can be
    crucial in controlling the flow of your application.For example, you could
    use middleware to authenticate users before they are allowed to access
    certain parts of your application. You could also use middleware to log
    requests and responses, or to cache frequently accessed data.
  </p>
  <p>
    By carefully considering the order in which you define your middleware
    functions, you can create a powerful and flexible way to control the flow of
    your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now run your server by executing nodemon index.js. Do not forget to test
    your server. To do this, open your web browser and access the following URLs
    to see how the new routes and middleware are handled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>http://localhost:3000/blog/1 (replace '1' with the actual post ID)</li>
    <li>http://localhost:3000/about</li>
    http://localhost:3000/secured (with auth=true as a query parameter to
    authenticate)
  </ul>
  <p>
    As you continue to explore the depths of middleware, you gain a better
    understanding of how to control the request/response cycle and manage
    various aspects of your web application. This is the outcome for the last
    url. Ensure all urls work properly.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node33.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    Donâ€™t worry about authentication right now, we will be handling
    authentication later on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we will explore advanced middleware concepts and understand their
    importance in real-world web applications. We will dive into error handling
    middleware and discuss how middleware can be used in practical scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    Error handling middleware is crucial for managing errors in your
    application. You can also use middleware to handle other types of errors,
    such as 500 (Internal Server Error) errors. By using middleware to handle
    errors, you can ensure that your application provides a consistent and
    informative experience to your users, even when something goes wrong. Let's
    create an error handling middleware to handle 404 (Not Found) errors.
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">

      // ... previous code ...
      // Error handling middleware for 404 Not Found
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.status(404).send("404 Not Found");
      });      
        
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    One common practical scenario for middleware is user authentication. Here's
    an example of how middleware can be used for user authentication:
  </p>

  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      // ... previous code ...
      // Simulate user authentication middleware
      const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
      if (req.query.auth === 'true') {
      // The user is authenticated, allow access to the protected route
      next();
      } else {
      // The user is not authenticated, send an error response
      res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
      }
      };
      // Apply the 'authenticateUser' middleware to a protected route
      app.get('/dashboard', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
      res.send('Welcome to the dashboard!');
      });
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Now run the server by executing node index.js. Open your web browser and
    access the following URLs to see how the error handling middleware and
    authentication middleware are applied:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      http://localhost:3000/nonexistent (should trigger the 404 error handler)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node34.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    Error handling middleware is essential for gracefully handling errors in
    your application, and authentication middleware is crucial for protecting
    restricted routes. Error handling middleware allows you to gracefully handle
    errors and provide a consistent and informative experience to your users,
    even when something goes wrong. For example, you can use error handling
    middleware to log errors, send informative error messages to your users, and
    redirect users to a friendly error page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Authentication middleware allows you to protect restricted routes from
    unauthorized access. For example, you can use authentication middleware to
    require users to be logged in before they can access certain pages or
    resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using error handling middleware and authentication middleware, you can
    create a more robust and secure application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we will explore real world scenarios where middleware plays a crucial
    role in running web applications. We shall be looking at request logging,
    request parsing among others.
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  <p><strong>Request Logging Middleware</strong></p>
  <p>
    Let us start with request logging. Request logging middleware is commonly
    used to log details of incoming requests, which can be valuable for
    monitoring and debugging. Here's how you can create a simple request logging
    middleware. We add this middleware at the top of the page before starting to
    add routes then navigate to the about page on the browser. Move back to your
    vsCode and look at the results on the terminal.
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      // ... previous code ...

      // Request logging middleware
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
      next();
      });      
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This is where this code should be and you should be able to see the results
    on the node console as shown on the image below.
  </p>
  <img
    class="img-fluid"
    src="{% static 'Images/node/node35.png'%}"
    alt=""
  /><br />
  <p><strong>Request Parsing Middleware</strong></p>
  <p>
    Next we shall look at request parsing middleware. Request parsing middleware
    is used to process data from requests. For example, you can create a
    middleware to parse JSON data from the request body.This is an example of
    the format . though we are not adding it in our code.
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">

      // JSON parsing middleware
      app.use(express.json()); // Automatically parses JSON data in the request body
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <br />
  <p><strong>File Upload Middleware</strong></p>
  <p>
    Middleware is commonly used for file upload handling. This is because
    middleware can be used to perform common tasks before and after file
    uploads, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Authenticating users: Middleware can be used to authenticate users before
      they are allowed to upload files. This can help to prevent unauthorized
      users from uploading files to your application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Validating file uploads: Middleware can be used to validate file uploads
      to ensure that they are valid and meet certain criteria, such as file size
      limits and allowed file types.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sanitizing file uploads: Middleware can be used to sanitize file uploads
      to remove any malicious code or content.
    </li>
    <li>
      Saving file uploads: Middleware can be used to save file uploads to a
      storage location, such as a database or a file system.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are a number of popular middleware packages that can be used for file
    upload handling in Node.js, such as Multer and Express-FileUpload. These
    packages provide a simple and easy-to-use way to handle file uploads in your
    application. Here's an example of middleware for file uploads using the
    multer package. Do not add this to our code.
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">
      const multer = require('multer');
      const storage = multer.diskStorage({
      destination: (req, file, cb) => {
      cb(null, 'uploads/');
      },
      filename: (req, file, cb) => {
      cb(null, file.originalname);
      },
      });      
      
      const upload = multer({ storage });      
      
      // File upload middleware
      app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
      res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
      });
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Middleware is a versatile and powerful tool in web development, making it
    possible to handle various aspects of request processing and data
    manipulation.
  </p>
  <br /><br />

  <h2>Routing</h2>
  <p>
    In this chapter, we'll explore routing in Express.js. Routing is a
    fundamental concept in web development that allows you to handle different
    HTTP methods and URL paths effectively. <br />To define a route in
    Express.js, you use one of the following methods:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>app.get(): Handles GET requests.</li>
    <li>app.post(): Handles POST requests.</li>
    <li>app.put(): Handles PUT requests.</li>
    <li>app.delete(): Handles DELETE requests.</li>
    <li>app.all(): Handles all HTTP requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each method takes two arguments: the path of the route and a callback
    function. The callback function is executed when a request is made to the
    specified path. We had already looked at routing before when we accessed the
    home, about and blog page but let us look at some more examples. Do not add
    this code in our index.js file. Here's how to create routes for different
    HTTP methods:
  </p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">

      // Define a GET route
      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('This is the homepage.');
      });      
      
      // Define a POST route
      app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
      // Handle POST data and create a resource
      res.send('Resource created.');
      });      
      
      // Define a PUT route
      app.put('/update/:id', (req, res) => {
      // Update a resource by ID
      res.send(`Resource with ID ${req.params.id} updated.`);
      });      
      
      // Define a DELETE route
      app.delete('/delete/:id', (req, res) => {
      // Delete a resource by ID
      res.send(`Resource with ID ${req.params.id} deleted.`);
      });      
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Express allows you to define route parameters by using a colon followed by
    the parameter name in the route definition. You can access these parameters
    using req.params. Route parameters are a powerful feature of Express.js that
    allows you to create complex and dynamic web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routing is a core concept in building web applications with Express.js, and
    it allows you to create organized and structured APIs. By using routing, you
    can define different routes for your application, and each route can handle
    a different HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL path.
    Overall, routing is an essential feature for building web applications with
    Express.js. By using routing, you can create organized, structured, and
    secure APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we shall delve deeper into routing in Express.js by exploring advanced
    concepts. We'll discuss route nesting, route modularity, and how to
    structure your application using routers.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><strong> Assignment </strong></p>
  <p>
    Read and try out the advanced concepts of routing. That includes, route
    nesting , route modularity and using modular routers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> By exploring advanced routing concepts, you're
    enhancing the organization and scalability of your Express.js applications
  </p>
  <br /><br />

  <h2>MVC REST API</h2>
  <p>
    In this part, we will learn how to build a RESTful API using Express.js. A
    RESTful API is a common way to interact with web services, allowing clients
    to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
  </p>
  <p>RESTful APIs are based on the following principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Resources: RESTful APIs model resources, such as users, products, or
      orders.
    </li>
    <li>
      HTTP methods: RESTful APIs use the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
      to perform CRUD operations on resources.
    </li>
    <li>URIs: RESTful APIs use URIs to identify resources.</li>
    <li>
      Statelessness: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request is
      independent of any other request.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To create a RESTful API, we'll first define the structure of your API.
    Decide on the resources you want to expose through your API. For example,
    you might create an API for managing books. Let us create another project
    and name it node06. Create an index.js file then open the application with
    visual studio code.
  </p>
  <p>Create an index.html file and add the code below</p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-html">

&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>My Web Server&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;h1> Home Page&lt;/h1>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>     
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Install nodemon and express using the commands below on the terminal.</p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">

      $ npm i nodemon
      $ npm i express    
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Here's a basic API structure:</p>
  <p>Add the code below in the index.js file</p>
  <div class="code-wrapper">
    <div id="copy-button"><i class="bi bi-stickies-fill"></i></div>
    <pre><code class="language-js">

      // In index.js
      const express = require('express');
      const app = express();
      const port = 3000;      
      
      const books = [
      { id: 1, title: 'Book 1 - Programming' },
      { id: 2, title: 'Book 2 - Node.js' },
      ];      
      
      // Define routes
      app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      // Serve the HTML page
      res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
      });      
      
      // Define routes for the RESTful API
      app.get('/api/books', (req, res) => {
      res.json(books);
      });      
      
      app.get('/api/books/:id', (req, res) => {
      const bookId = parseInt(req.params.id);
      const book = books.find(book => book.id === bookId);
      if (!book) return res.status(404).send('Book not found');
      res.json(book);
      });      
      
      // Add routes for POST, PUT, and DELETE operations
      // ...
      
      
      app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log('Server is running on port ' + port);
      });
      
     </code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    On the terminal run the node server using nodemon index.Now that the server
    is up and running, let us test the server. Open your web browser and accesss
    <strong><em> http://localhost:3000.</em> </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigate to url
    <strong><em>http://localhost:3000/api/books </em></strong> and you should be
    able to see the results on the browser.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node36.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>CRUD Operations:</p>
  <p>
    To create a complete RESTful API, you need to add routes for all CRUD
    operations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>POST</li>
    <p>
      The POST method is used to create a new resource. The request body
      contains the data for the new resource. The response body contains the
      newly created resource. For example, to create a new user, you would send
      a POST request to the /users endpoint with the user's data in the request
      body. The response body would contain the newly created user object.
    </p>
    <li>PUT</li>
    <p>
      The PUT method is used to update an existing resource. The request body
      contains the updated data for the resource. The response body contains the
      updated resource. For example, to update a user's profile, you would send
      a PUT request to the /users/:id endpoint with the updated user data in the
      request body. The response body would contain the updated user object.
    </p>
    <li>DELETE</li>
    <p>
      The DELETE method is used to delete a resource. The response body is
      empty. For example, to delete a user, you would send a DELETE request to
      the /users/:id endpoint. The response body would be empty, but you could
      use the HTTP status code to indicate whether the deletion was successful.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using the appropriate HTTP methods and status codes in a RESTful API is
    important for adhering to REST principles. The following is a summary of the
    most common HTTP methods and status codes used in RESTful APIs:
  </p>
  <p>HTTP methods:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>GET: Used to retrieve a resource.</li>
    <li>POST: Used to create a new resource.</li>
    <li>PUT: Used to update an existing resource.</li>
    <li>DELETE: Used to delete a resource.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>Status codes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      200 OK: The request was successful and the response body contains the
      requested data.
    </li>
    <li>
      201 Created: The request was successful and a new resource was created.
    </li>
    <li>400 Bad Request: The request was invalid.</li>
    <li>404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.</li>
    <li>
      500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Creating a RESTful API is a fundamental step in building web services. It
    allows you to create APIs that are easy to use, scalable, and flexible.
