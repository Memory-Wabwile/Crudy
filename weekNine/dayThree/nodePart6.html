  <h1>Node.js Project</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    So far so good. Am assuming you had a great journey to this point. I surely
    have enjoyed the Node.js journey. Before bringing a real-life project to
    life with what we have learned in Node.js, let us take a step back and
    review what we have grasped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a pause and ask yourself, if someone were to ask me what Node.js is,
    what would be my answer? Tik tok tik tok.
  </p>
  <p>
    If it were for me, I would simply state that Node.js is an
    <strong
      ><em>asynchronous, event-driven, Javascript runtime environment</em>
    </strong>
    designed to develop
    <strong><em>scalable network applications</em></strong> . Wow, slow down
    there and take a break. What do you mean by all this tech jargon you just
    threw around for me in your definition? Well, let us see what we simply mean
    by all this.
  </p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <strong><em>Asynchronous:- </em></strong>this simply means that two or
      more processes can be run at the same time without interfering with each
      other or one waiting for the other.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Event Driven:- </em></strong>this means that the flow of a
      program or process will be determined by an event taking place.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Javascript runtime environment:- </em></strong> refers to the
      provision of libraries, tools, or infrastructure that facilitate the
      running of Javascript code on a computer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Scalable:-</em></strong> easy to change the size in terms of
      increasing the size or reducing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><em>Network application:- </em></strong>a network application is
      an application that runs on one host that provides communication to
      another communication on another application running on a different host.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>
    With this understanding of the Node.js terms used in its definition, how
    does Node.js fall in delivering all these?
  </p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <strong> Asynchronous:-</strong> any application developed using Node.js
      will pass async tasks to an event loop together with a callback. This
      event pool will efficiently manage a thread pool of tasks and execute them
      efficiently. Then each callback will be executed as the tasks are
      complete.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Event Driven:-</strong> From the asynchronous point above, we have
      noted that with Node.js an event pool will be created. This means that an
      event has to take place for a Node.js driven process to take place.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Javascript runtime environment:-</strong> Javascript is a
      programming language. So Node.js will provide the platform upon which the
      commands are written in JS to run. For example, with Javascript, we have
      events like click, hover, mousein, and mouseout to mention a few. These
      events are what trigger Node.js processes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scalable:-</strong> with Node.js, we can be able to easily grow
      the side of the program in terms of tasks it handles without affecting any
      other tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network application:-</strong> With Node.js, one can be able to
      write Javascript on both the front and back end. This means that a
      full-stack application can be developed using Node.js. The front end will
      be an application on one host and the back end will be on a different
      host. However, with Node.js, the back-end application will be able to
      communicate with the front-end application without there being the need
      for a server-side programming language involved.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Well, that's awesome. Imagine the power you could possess when developing
    applications with such unlimited power. You do not need to think too hard
    and far about such possibilities. Node.js is here to power such
    possibilities. Now it is time for the rubber to meet the road by taking up a
    real-time project. For this series, we will develop a contact manager
    application using Node.js. Take a minute, get that cup of coffee, and letâ€™s
    do this
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2>The crawling stage</h2>
  <p>
    For this project, we will develop several APIs including but not limited to
    managing contacts. In developing the API, this is the Rest API Convention
    that we will use for the application:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node37.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    The CRUD actions will be the processes that will be event-based in our
    project. For example, the Get all contact action will be initiated by a get
    all contact contact command. Based on the CRUD actions, we will have
    different HTTP methods that will be communicated over specific endpoints as
    we said Node.js delivers network applications. Looking at the structure of
    the application, we can scale it further in the future by adding a CURD
    action like export or share contacts that will have a GET HTTP method.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2>Project Setup</h2>
  <p><strong>Node version and installations</strong></p>
  <p>
    The very first step is to ensure that we have Node.js installed on our
    machines. Open your terminal and run the command
    <strong>node.js -v</strong> to check the existing version of Node.js. If it
    does not exist, kindly refer to the official Node.js documentation via:
    https://nodejs.org/en. It is always advisable to ensure that you are using
    the latest LTS version of Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have nvm on your PC, you can simply use it to install the desired
    version of Node.js that you wish to have on your PC. You will simply use the
    command: <strong> nvm install &lt;versionnumber></strong>. Below is an
    example of an upgrade of node from version 18 to 20 using nvm:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node38.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    You can use the command <strong> nvm use &lt;versionnumber> </strong> to
    switch between the versions of node that you wish to use on your PC:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node39.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    We also need to ensure that we set the latest node version as the default on
    our PC. To do this, we use the command
    <strong>node alias default &lt;version> </strong>
  </p>
  <br />

  <p><strong>Project Directory Setup</strong></p>
  <p>
    After confirming that we are running on the latest LTS version of node, we
    will now create our project directory that will house our project. For this
    project, I will cd into my Documents directory, create a directory called
    Node.js and inside it create another directory called expresscontact.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node40.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    Inside our project directory, we will have a directory for the endpoints
    which we will name mycontact-backend. Once we change the directory into the
    endpoints directory, we will initialize our application using the command
    npm init. Upon running the app initialization command, several questions
    will be asked and will provide the following responses:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Package name:- you could name the packages with a valid name. This project
      has named the packages contacts-api.
    </li>
    <li>Version:- We shall leave the version at 1.0.0</li>
    <li>
      Description:- you can give a broad description of the project in a single
      precise line.
    </li>
    <li>Entry point:- we shall have the entry point as server.js</li>
    <li>Test command:- we shall leave it empty.</li>
    <li>Git repository:- we shall leave it empty.</li>
    <li>Keywords:- we shall leave them empty.</li>
    <li>Author:- use your name as the author.</li>
    <li>License:- MIT</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Press enter and type Okay.</p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node41.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    We will then open the application on our VS code editor using the command
    <strong>code .</strong><br />
    There is a package.json file that exists in the project folder we just
    created. It will contain all the settings that we have set above:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node42.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    Since we shall push our code to GitHub, there are files that we will not
    wish to be pushed to GitHub. In respect, we shall have a .gitignore file. In
    this file, we will add the node modules and the .env file:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node43.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    In the .nev file, we will have settings and files that will be used only for
    development purposes.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2>Creating an Express Server</h2>
  <p>
    For us to create the express server, we will create the file that we
    declared as our entry point for the project. This is the serve.js. Inside
    the serve.js file, we will create a basic express server. Before we create
    the express server, we will have to install it on our PC. To install the
    server, open up the terminal either in Vs code or the pc terminal and run
    the command <strong>npm install express.</strong> Upon successfully running
    the command, the results will be:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node44.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    You will also notice that in the file structures, there is a node_modules
    directory that has been added and a package-lock.json file.
  </p>
  <p>
    To streamline our development process, we will also install
    <strong>nodemon</strong>. This will help us as it will restart the server
    whenever a change is made hence picking up the change made:
    <strong> npm i -D nodemon</strong>:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node45.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    To verify that the above dependencies have been added, we can take a look at
    our package.json file to see if they have been listed inside there:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node46.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    Having the installations ready, we have to start our server. To run our
    server, we have to update the scripts in the package.json file. As you can
    see from the above image and as you can verify from your file, under
    scripts, we only have one test script. We will then add a start and
    development script:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node47.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    We can now run our server using the command <strong>npm run dev</strong>. We
    are running dev since we are using a development server:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node48.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    From the above image, we can see that the nodemon is awaiting changes so it
    can restart. This guarantees us that if the change is made, it will be
    updated without us having to restart the server. Above that, we can see that
    serve.js has been started. However, it is empty as you can recall. Let us
    add a simple console message and see what the change will be:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node49.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>With consoling the message above, the changes that will take place are:</p>

  <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Images/node/node50.png'%}" alt="" />
  <p>
    We can see that nodemon has been restarted and the serve.js started with the
    message inside the console being printed out. After the changes have been
    effected, the nodemon then awaits more changes to take effect. Now that we
    are assured that nodemod is working and is monitoring our script file which
    is where we are to set up the express server, let us go ahead and set up the
    server.
